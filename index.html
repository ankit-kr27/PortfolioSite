            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p>I'm Ankit and I'm 21. I love tech, I like creating things. Coffee is my weakness.

                <h3>C++ Programming</h3>
                <p>I Started learning the C++ language, back when I was in high school. And I'd must say that it made me fall in love with coding. After that, all I just wanted to do is to keep on creating things. It made me think about a lot of things from multiple perspectives. It helped me breakdown problem causing stuffs into small fragments and get over them.</p>

                <h3>C Programming</h3>
                <p>I've got the first glimpse of the C language when I've been part of a robotics workshop at my secondary school. Although I'm really not very fond of this language, but this language has my respect for it's legacy.</p>

                <h3>Web-Development</h3>
                <p>this is the one skill that I'm currently acquiring, and I am totally ejoying the process of creating beautiful websites as of now. I'd like to get to know how designing works, but the one thing that I really want to get in depth of is the vastness of the backend stuffs.

                <h3>Writing</h3>
                <p>This thing, I really don't know whether it's a skill or a hobby. It's just that I love to express myself in any form, whether by speaking to friends and family or by writing. And writing really feels more intimate way to express myself.</p>
